# Corleo's fork of [Martin Madsen's CV][1].

This CV is an modification of both friggeri-cv and [Martin's fork][1]. It uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue and FontAwesome 5 for icons. The bibliography stuff was removed.

Default language was set to brazilian portuguese at the *.cls file.

Like [Martin Madsen's][1] fork, it has some macroes that print social sites.
